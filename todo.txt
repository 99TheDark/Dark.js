To add:
• Gradient fill & stroke
• Colorspaces
• blendColor
• DImage.noise(x, y, width, height) / DImage.noise(x, y, z, width, height, depth) (See https://github.com/thomcc/quick-noise.js/blob/master/quick-noise.js)
* Image masking (Using GLSL)
• Make DVector rotations work in 3D
• DImage.split to split an image into an array of images
* Seperate static functions and changeable functions (like sign vs rotate)
• Switch from loading OffscreenCanvas onto the window to a Dark property
• Mask DImage.initializeShaders and such cache all shaders including filters

Possibly to add:
• Store shapes in variables, maybe DShape
• Transformations from point for ease of use (maybe with DShape)
• println-like console
• Font library for Google Fonts (Like https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/i/6162502356762624)
• Audio
• Cursor lock function — lockCursor() & unlockCursor()
• Contours (negative shapes)
• Framerate above natural refresh rate
• Average & Color palette splitter using median cut
• texture() for shapes
• DSort object (a bunch of sorting algorithms, static object)
• DComplex object (complex numbers, ie a+bi)
• Convert all Objects to classes

Bugs:
• Dark.js mouse breaks when width / height is not the same as the style width / height
• Dark not defined on FireFox Khan Academy
• Bold text doesn't work on Safari

Note: '*' means to add by next minor update versus '•' which means to add eventually
