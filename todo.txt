To add:
* Gradient fill & stroke
• Colorspaces
• blendColor
• Noise (See https://github.com/thomcc/quick-noise.js/blob/master/quick-noise.js)
• DImage.noise(), use WebGL to fill the imageWidth. Might even create 4 with the RGBA
* Image masking
• Make DVector rotations work in 3D
• Make everything readonly in Dark instances
* Share image cache onto main Dark
* imageData, loadPixels & updatePixels main
• Better global variable updating & handling for events specifically
• DColor
• Speed up crop & resize by a TON
* Cache and use frequently used images
* Make loadImage more efficient and include bitmaps now
• Make bulkAdd etc use Object.defineProperties for readonly
• Make all static DMatrix functions use copies
• Allow DMatrix constructor to take in many arrays opposed to a 2D array
• DImage.split to split an image into an array of images

Possibly to add:
• Store shapes in variables, maybe DShape
• Transformations from point for ease of use (maybe to DShape)
• println-like console
• Font library for Google Fonts (Like https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/i/6162502356762624)
• Audio
• Local storage, cookies, etc easy support
• Cursor lock function — lockCursor() & unlockCursor()
• Contours (negative shapes)
• Framerate above natural refresh rate
• Average & Color palette splitter using median cut
• texture() for shapes
• DSort object (a bunch of sorting algorithms, static object)
• DComplex object (complex numbers, ie a+bi)
• DSprite object (pixel art ease of making)
• Convert all Objects to classes

Bugs:
• Dark.js mouse breaks when width / height is not the same as the style width / height
• Obscure bug with text alignment. See CoC Main. 
• reset just breaks everything

Note: '*' means to add by next minor update versus '•' which means to add eventually
