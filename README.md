# Dark.js

Closesly modeled after both [Processing.js](https://github.com/processing-js/processing-js) and [ski.js](https://github.com/thelegendski/ski.js/).
Dark.js hopes to fix a few technicaly issues with ski.js, be much faster than ProcessingJS, but also add new features that make using Dark.js worth it.
This project is currently in development, yet to even have a 1.0 release. I guess just see my _long_ list of To-do's if you're interested.

You most likely saw this from Khan Academy, in which case you can see more of what I do on my [Profile](https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/kaid_1007444411542956194078854/projects).

Once this is done, I will probably make a Github Pages site with documentation & other miscellaneous things.

### And of course, check out the amazing libraries this is based off of.
