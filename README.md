# Dark.js
Closesly modeled after both [Processing.js](https://github.com/processing-js/processing-js) and [ski.js](https://github.com/thelegendski/ski.js/).
Dark.js hopes to fix a few technicaly issues with ski.js, be much faster than ProcessingJS, but also add new features that make using Dark.js worth it.

This project is currently in development, yet to even have a 1.0 release. I guess just see my _long_ list of To-do's if you're interested.

Of course, check out the amazing libraries this is based off of.
